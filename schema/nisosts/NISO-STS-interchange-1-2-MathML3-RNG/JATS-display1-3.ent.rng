  Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
     ==============================================================
       JATS Version 1.3 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                    (DAL/BTU) v1.3 (2021-06-10)
  
       ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
       which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
       to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
       by ANSI vote on June 10, 2021, so it supersedes all Committee 
       Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.3 2021 (the version
       submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.3 20210610 
       (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).
  
       The file names and formal public identifiers have been 
       changed in the modules and the catalogs.
  
   34. JATS 'v1.3d2 20201130' becomes 'v1.3 20210610' 
       (final ANSI vote date)
       'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021'
  
    ==============================================================
       JATS Version 1.3d2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                     (DAL/BTU) v1.3d2 (2020-11-30)
  
       ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
       which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
       to be changed. 
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
       or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
       testing. The formal public identifiers have been changed 
       in the modules and the catalogs.
  
   33. OBJECT ID Added <object-id> to: 
          <block-alternatives>, <fig-group>, <table-wrap-group> 
  
   32. JATS "v1.3d2 20201130" becomes 'v1.3 20210610' (second 
       committee draft following the final ANSI/NISO 1.2 vote)
  
     ==============================================================
       JATS Version 1.3d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                     (DAL/BTU) v1.3.d1 (2019-08-31)
  
       ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
       which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
       to be changed. 
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
       or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
       modules and the catalogs.
  
   31. MEDIA MODEL - Added <xref> to media model and graphic model.
  
   30. NEW BLOCK ALTERNATIVES - Added new block element
       <block-alternatives> to hold block-level processing
       alternatives, such as the same figure in two languages.
       The new element can be used anywhere figure is used.
  
   29. ADDED SUBJECTS TO WHEREVER KEYWORDS ALLOWED - Added
       <subj-group> directly to the following elements:
        - chem-struct-wrap 
        - fig and fig-group
        - graphic
        - media
        - supplementary-material (thru fig-model)
        - table-wrap and table-wrap-group
  
   28. MULTI-LANGUAGE FIGURE AND TABLE LABELS AND CAPTIONS
  
       - Made <label> repeatable inside <fig> and
         <fig-group> to allow both labels and captions to 
         repeat to be tagged in multiple languages:
           label   xml-lang="a"
           label   xml-lang="b"
           caption xml-lang="a"
           caption xml-lang="a"
  
       - Made <label> repeatable inside <fig-model> to allow for
         both labels and captions to be tagged in multiple
         languages:
           label   xml-lang="a"
           label   xml-lang="b"
           caption xml-lang="a"
           caption xml-lang="a"
  
        - Similar change inside <table-wrap> for the same reason.
  
        - Similar change inside <table-wrap-group> for the same reason.
  
   27. LINKING TABLES TO SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
  
       - Added the <xref> element (for an internal cross-reference)
         to the large OR-group inside the body of a 
         <table-wrap-group>, to be used to make a link to a 
         <supplementary-material> element as a way of recording 
         that a dataset or similar is the data from which the 
         tables in the <table-wrap-group> were derived.
  
   25. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.3d1 20190831" (first committee
       draft following the final ANSI/NISO vote) 
  
     ==============================================================

                                     (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2019-02-08)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
       to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
       by ANSI vote on Feb 08, 2019, so it supersedes all Committee 
       Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.2 2018 (the version
       submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.2 20190208 
       (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021).
  
   24. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.2 20190208" (final ANSI vote date)
       "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015" becomes "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019"

       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
       or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
       modules and the catalogs.
  
   22. INLINE-MEDIA - Added new element <inline-media>, which is to
       <media> as <inline-graphic> is to <graphic>. The content
       model is the same as <inline-supplementary-material>, in
       other words there should be content, this is not typically 
       an empty element. The attributes are the same as <media>,
       except without @position and @orientation.
  
   21. BITS "2.0" and "v2.0 20151225" remain unchanged
  
       JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231" became

       NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 
  
       NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
       suggestions from the NISO request forms.
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
  
   13. CAPTION ATTRIBUTE - Changed the mechanism by which the @style
        attribute is associated with the element <caption>. 
        Previously, the <caption> element's base attributes were 
        declared in this module and additional attributes (@style) 
        for it were declared in the XHTML Table Module. The @style 
        attribute is now declared in this module, and the caption 
        attributes in the XHTML table model have been set to IGNORE. 
        This was done to make sure that the attributes available on 
        the JATS <caption> element did not change based on which table
        model a JATS user was using.
  
   12. CODE - Added the new element <code> (using code-atts and
       code-elements). Resembles <preformat>, but different
       semantics.
  
   11. CAPTION ATTRIBUTES - Added the new PE %jats-common-atts; to
       the caption attributes, even though doing so while making
       no other changes would mean multiple definitions
       of the @id and @content-type attributes. This would produce a
       warning, which should be ignored, so see item #13 above.
  
   10. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
           %jats-common-atts;
       to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
       @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
       whether metadata or narrative.
       Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
       parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
       The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
       entity.
  
    9. ABSTRACT AND KEYWORDS ON NEW STRUCTURES
       - Added <abstract> (through %abstract.class;) and <kwd-group> 
         (through %kwd-group.class;) to the following elements:
          - chem-struct-wrap (through %chem-struct-wrap-model;)
          - fig (through %fig-model;)
          - fig-group (through %fig-group-model;)
          - graphic (through %graphic-model;)
          - media (through %media-model;)
          - table-wrap (through %table-wrap-model;)
          - table-wrap-group (through %table-wrap-group-model;)
  
       =============================================================
       NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
  
    8. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
       public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".
  
       =============================================================
       Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
  
       This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
       The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
       Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
       becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
       have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
       "Version 0.4".
  
       Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
  
    7. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
  
    6. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
       modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
       and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
       new version number "0".
  
    5. INLINE GRAPHIC - Uses new class %small-access.class; (no
       model change)
  
    4. POSITION ATTRIBUTE - Added the value "background"
  
    3. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
       @xml:lang to %display-atts;. If these attribute were
       already part of the list, deleted them. These attributes were
       added to:
        - array       (already there)
        - boxed-text  (already there)
        - caption     (already there)
        - chem-struct (added @xml:lang, @specific-use already)
        - chem-struct-wrap (added @xml:lang, @specific-use already)
        - fig (already there)
        - fig-group (added @xml:lang, @specific-use already there)
        - graphic (added @xml:lang, @specific-use already there)
        - inline-graphic (both)
        - media (added @xml:lang, @specific -use already there)
        - preformat (already there)
        - supplementary-material (already there)
        - table-wrap (already there)
        - table-wrap-group (added @xml:lang, @specific -use
            already there)
  
    2. GRAPHIC MODEL - Removed the dependency which had both
       <graphic> and <media> modeled with the same parameter
       entity %graphic-model. Created new PE for %media-model;
       but set it (as the default) to %graphic-model so that no
       customization would break. NEW PE
