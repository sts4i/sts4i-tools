<!-- SYSTEM:     Journal Publishing DTD of the JATS DTD Suite -->
<!---->
<!-- PURPOSE:    To declare the Parameter Entities (PEs) used to -->
<!-- over-ride the content models, parts of content -->
<!-- models, or attribute lists of the JATS DTD Suite -->
<!---->
<!-- Or-groups within models should use mixes or -->
<!-- classes rather than name elements directly. -->
<!---->
<!-- Note: Since PEs must be declared before they -->
<!-- are used, this module must be called before the -->
<!-- content modules that declare elements. -->

<!-- CREATED FOR: -->
<!-- This DTD was created from the JATS DTD Suite. -->
<!-- Digital archives and publishers may use the -->
<!-- DTD as is for markup of journal literature or -->
<!-- related material for archiving and transferring -->
<!-- such material between archives or create a -->
<!-- custom XML DTD from the Suite for -->
<!-- these purposes. -->
<!---->
<!-- This DTD is in the public domain. An organization -->
<!-- that wishes to create its own DTD from the suite -->
<!-- may do so without permission from NLM. -->
<!---->
<!-- The suite has been set up to be extended using a -->
<!-- new DTD file and a new DTD-specific customization -->
<!-- module to redefine the many Parameter Entities. -->
<!-- Do not modify the suite directly or redistribute -->
<!-- modified versions of the suite. -->
<!---->
<!-- In the interest of maintaining consistency and -->
<!-- clarity for potential users, NLM requests: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. If you create a DTD from the JATS DTD Suite -->
<!-- and intend to stay compatible with the suite, -->
<!-- then please include the following statement -->
<!-- as a comment in all of your DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Created from, and fully compatible with, -->
<!-- the ANSI/NISO Z39.96 Journal Article Tag -->
<!-- Suite (JATS)." -->
<!---->
<!-- 2. If you alter one or more modules of the suite, -->
<!-- then please rename your version and all its -->
<!-- modules to avoid any confusion with the -->
<!-- original suite. Also, please include the -->
<!-- following statement as a comment in all your -->
<!-- DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Based in part on, but not fully compatible -->
<!-- with, the ANSI/NISO Z39.96 Journal Article -->
<!-- Tag Suite (JATS)." -->

  Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
     ==============================================================
       JATS Version 1.3 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                    (DAL/BTU) v1.3 (2021-06-10)
  
       ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
       which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
       to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
       by ANSI vote on June 10, 2021, so it supersedes all Committee 
       Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.3 2021 (the version
       submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.3 20210610 
       (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).
  
       The file names and formal public identifiers have been 
       changed in the modules and the catalogs.
  
   51. JATS 'v1.3d2 20201130' becomes 'v1.3 20210610' 
       (final ANSI vote date)
       'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021'
  
    ==============================================================
       JATS Version 1.3d2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                     (DAL/BTU) v1.3d2 (2020-11-30)
  
       ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
       which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
       to be changed. 
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
       or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
       testing. The formal public identifiers have been changed 
       in the modules and the catalogs.
  
   50. NEW DATE-ONLY CLASS
         - Added <history> model override, because default
           JATS uses both <date> and <string-date> in 
           <history>, while Publishing uses only <date>.
         - Added <event> model override, because default
           JATS uses both <date> and <string-date> in 
           <event>, while Publishing uses only <date>.
  
   49. OBJECT ID Added <object-id> to: 
          <abstract>, <ack>, <list>, trans-abstract>
          <fig-group> (model removed as was same as default) 
  
   48. EXPANSION OF FIXED ATTRIBUTES LIST: There are four  
       content-defined attributes which are CDATA values 
       (undetermined) in Archiving, but which are named value 
       lists in Publishing/Authoring:
         - @fn-type            (override is in this module)
         - @person-group-type  (override is in this module)
         - @pub-id-type
         - @ref-type 
       In order to give users of Publishing and Authoing
       more flexibility to name new values without 
       destroying the benefit of named value lists:
         - A new value “custom” has been added to the named
             value list of each of these four attributes.
         - A new attribute @custom-type has been added to
             each element that takes one of these attributes.
       In this module:
        - The element <fn> was given the new attribute 
          @custom-type and "custom" was added to
          %fn-types (the footnote type named value list).
        - The element <person-group> was given the new 
          attribute @custom-type and "custom" was added to
          %person-group-types (the person group type named 
          value list). As an example: 
             <person-group @person-group-type=”custom” 
              custom-type=”statisticians”>
       The Best Practice rule (unenforceable in DTDs, but  
       enforceable in Schematron) is, that if you use the 
       value “custom” from one of these lists, you should 
       also record what type of 'custom' in the 
       @custom-type attribute.
  
   46. SEE ALSO - The four vocabulary attributes were added to
       <see-also>, which is defined in the BITS question-answer
       model.
  
   45. ISSUE TITLE GROUP - Added <issue-title-group> to 
       <article-meta>  (optional, repeatable)
  
   44. JATS "v1.3d2 20201130" becomes 'v1.3 20210610' (second 
       committee draft following the final ANSI/NISO 1.2 vote)
  
     ==============================================================
       JATS Version 1.3d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                     (DAL/BTU) v1.3.d1 (2019-08-31)
  
       ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
       which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
       to be changed. 
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
       or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
       modules and the catalogs.
  
   43. ADDED SUBJECTS TO WHEREVER KEYWORDS ALLOWED - Added
       <subj-group> directly to the following elements:
        - fig 
        - fig-group 
  
   42. MULTI-LANGUAGE FIGURE AND TABLE LABELS AND CAPTIONS
  
       - Made <label> repeatable inside <fig> and
         <fig-group> to allow both labels and captions to 
         repeat to be tagged in multiple languages:
           label   xml-lang="a"
           label   xml-lang="b"
           caption xml-lang="a"
           caption xml-lang="a"
  
   41. LINKING FIGURES TO SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
  
       - Added the <xref> element (for an internal cross-reference)
         to the large OR-group inside the body of a <figure>, to
         be used to make a link to a <supplementary-material>
         element as a way of recording that a dataset or similar is
         the data from which the figure was derived.
  
       - Also added the <xref> element (for internal cross-reference)
         to the OR-group inside of <fig-group> for the same
         reason, although inside groups will probably be rare.
  
   40. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.3d1 20190831" (first committee
       draft following the final ANSI/NISO vote) 
  
     ==============================================================
       JATS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                     (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2019-02-08)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
       to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
       by ANSI vote on Feb 08, 2019, so it supersedes all Committee 
       Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.2 2018 (the version
       submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.2 20190208 
       (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021).
  
   39. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.2 20190208" (final ANSI vote date)
       "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015" becomes "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019"
  
     ==============================================================
       JATS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2018)
  
                                     (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2018-11-30)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
       to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
       by ANSI and NISO vote, so it supersedes all Committee Drafts
       and becoming NISO JATS 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2018).
  
   38. 
       JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401" became
       JATS "1.2" and "v1.2 20181130" 
  
      =============================================================
  
       JATS Version 1.2d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d2  (2018-04-01)
  
       JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
       BITS is under continuous maintenance, and is modified at the
       discretion of the working group.
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
       or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
       modules and the catalogs.
  
   37. PERSON GROUP TYPES  - Replaced the CDATA value for 
       @person-group-type with list of values, parameter
       entity %person-group-types;, reversing the decision
       of Version 1.2d1.
  
   36. FOOTNOTES
        - Made @fn-type from CDATA into a restricted list,
          reversing the decision of version 1.2d1. 
        - Added back the %fn-types; PE, which is used for values of
          @fn-type
        - Added new value "coi-statement", which is best practice
          replacing value "conflict", which was left on the list.
  
   35. NON-MONETARY SUPPORT - Inside <article-meta> added new
       <support-group> to hold both funding and
       non-monetary support descriptions. <support-group> is 
       both a peer to <funding-group> (backward compatibility)
       and contains <funding-group>.
  
   34. PUBLICATION DATE-NOT-AVAILABLE - Inside <article-meta>, 
       <front-stub>, <event>, and <event-desc>
       added new element <pub-date-not-available>, as an 
       alternative to <pub-date>. The meaning is that a 
       publication date was (for whatever reason) not available. 
       Presence of the element says nothing about publication 
       status.
  
   33. BITS "2.0" and "v2.0 20151225" remain unchanged
  
  
       JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231" became
       JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401". 
  
       No module names were changed.
  
      =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.2d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015)
                                     (DAL/BTU) v1.2d1  (2017-12-31)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
       or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
       modules and the catalogs.
  
   32. JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20170631" became
       JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231". 
  
      =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.2d1              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d1  (2017-06-31)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
       or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
       modules and the catalogs.
  
   31. PERSON GROUP TYPES - Replaced the %person-group-types; parameter
       entity (allauthors | assignee | author | compiler | curator | 
       director | editor | guest-editor | illustrator | inventor |
       research-assistant | translator | transed) with CDATA to allow
       all types.
          [Note: Rescinded in JATS 1.2d1. @fn-type is still
          a value list Note on 2020-51-31]
  
   30. ARTICLE META MODEL
       - ARTICLE VERSION - Added new element <article-version>
         inside <article-meta> to hold one version number for the 
         article. <article-version> element may repeat inside
         <article-version-alternatives> to hold version numbers 
         from different systems.
  
       - NO DATE - <pub-date> (optional repeatable) is now
         followed by the optional new element 
         <pub-date-not-available>. 
  
       - PUBLICATION HISTORY - Added new element based on BITS,
         <pub-history>, to hold <event>s as <history> holds
         <date>s. New internal elements: <event>, <event-desc>
  
   29. FOOTNOTES
        - Made @fn-type into a CDATA from a restricted list.
          Deleted %fn-types; PE, which used to be used.
          [Note: Rescinded in JATS 1.2d1. @fn-type is still
          a value list Note on 2020-51-31]
  
   28. PERSON-GROUP
        - Removed string-name.class PE from PE person-group-elements
          because <string-name> was added to name.class, which
          person-group-elements already used.
  
   27. PERSON-GROUP - Made @person-group-type values into a parameter
       entity and added values "illustrator" and "research-assistant".
  
   26. JATS became version "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20170631" 
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)
  
       JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
       JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
       identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
       No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
  
   25. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"
       BITS remained version "2.0" but becomes "v2.0 20151225"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
  
       The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
       License and Indicators Recommended Practice.
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
   24. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1d3 20150301"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This catalog represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
   23. <VOLUME> INSIDE <ARTICLE-META>
     - Allowed <volume> to repeat inside <article-meta>, the types to 
       be distinguished using @content-type
     - Added new optional element <volume-issue-group> inside 
       <article-meta) following all volume and issue elements
       to hold volume-issue pairs (or n-tuples) when a second
       and subsequent <volume> has its own related issue
       information.
     - Made <issue> repeatable, for those who choose not to use
       the new wrapper element.
  
   32. VERSION ELEMENTS
       The new element <version> uses the PE %-just-rendition,
       but Authoring has set that PE to null, so the <version>
       element added <sup> and <sub> to be like the content
       of <edition>.
  
   31. VALUE LIST FOR PERSON-GROUP-TYPE
       Added "curator" to the list of person-group role values.
  
   30. EDITION ELEMENTS - Added <sub> and <sup> to the model of
       edition. These were needed now that the "Edition" element
       has been renamed and repurposed as "Edition Statement".
  
   29. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
  
   28. CONFERENCE LOCATION ELEMENTS AND PUBLISHER LOCATION ELEMENTS
        - Added 3 new OPTIONAL elements: <city>, <state>, 
          and <postal-code> by adding address.class

   27. ON-BEHALF-OF NEW CONTENT
       Added <xref>, <fn>, and <target> (the simple links) to 
       <on-behalf-of>.
  
   26. ADDED <string-date> to <mixed-citation> and <element-citation>
       through citation-elements.
  
   25. NEW ELEMENT <era>
       Added to the model of <date>, optional following year,
       through date-model.
  
   24. XML Base
       Added the attribute @xml:base to the Global (common)
       attributes used on all elements.
  
   23. INSTITUTION-WRAP ADDED
       Added the element <institution-wrap> to the following elements
       through the institution-wrap.class:
        - <conf-sponsor>
        - <publisher-name>
        - <std-organization>
  
   22.  GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
           %jats-common-atts;
       to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
       @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
       whether metadata or narrative.
       Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
       parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
       The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
       entity.
       All attribute lists in this module changed.
  
   21. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS ON NEW STRUCTURES
       - Added <abstract> (through %abstract.class;) and <kwd-group> 
         (through %kwd-group.class;) to the following elements:
          - ack (through %ack-model;)
          - fig (through %fig-model;)
          - fig-group (through %fig-group-model;)
  
       - Changed "abstract*" to "(%abstract.class;)*"
         and "kwd-group*" to "(%kwd-group.class;)*" since those
         classes now exist. Elements should have a limited number of
         ways to be invoked.
          - article-meta (through %article-meta-model;)
  
   20. ACKNOWLEDGMENT MODEL
       - Added optional, repeatable <kwd-group> to the beginning of 
         <ack> (through %ack-model;).

       NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
  
   19. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
       <related-article> was used, including inside 
       <article-meta> using article-meta-model.
  
   18. CONTRIBUTOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to the beginning
       at the <contrib> model, to hold identifiers for people,
       such as publishers-specific IDs and ORCIDs.
  
   17. STANDARDS ORGANIZATION - Added std-organization-elements
       to reduce what was allowed in the names of standards bodies.
  
   16. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL
       - Added <issn-l> as an optional element to <journal-meta>
       - Added contributors and affiliations to journal metadata through
         contrib-group.class (which resolves to <contrib-group>) and 
         aff-alternatives.class (which resolves to <aff> or
         <aff-alternatives>), using the journal-meta-model.
  
   15. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL
  
   14. PARAGRAPH PARAMETER ENTITY SYNTAX CHANGE (no models changed)
       Fixed content models that were stated as "p*" and "sec*"
       to use the %just-para.class;, %sec.class, and %ref-list.class; 
       classes. Element models that were changed include:
        - abstract
        - ack
        - trans-abstract
  
   13. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
       public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".
  
       =============================================================
       Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
  
       This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
       The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
       Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
       becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
       have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
       "Version 0.4".
  
       Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
  
   12. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
  
   11. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
       modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
       and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
       new version number "0".
  
   10. POSITION ATTRIBUTE - Added the value "background"
  
    9. PREFORMAT - Added <alt-text> and <long-desc> to <preformat> by
       adding %access.class; to %preformat-elements;
  
    8. INITIALS - Removed the attribute over-ride for <surname> and
       <given-names> to allow the use of @initials.
  
    7. JOURNAL METADATA- Added <notes> to repeat within <journal-meta>
       (through %journal-meta-model; and added @xml:lang and
       @specific-use to the attributes of <notes> through %notes-atts;
  
    6. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
       to <article-meta> through %article meta-model;. This element
       will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
       single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
       in two languages or two scripts.
  
    5. PERSON-GROUP - Became a mixed-content model, so the parameter
       entity %person-group-model: was changed to
       %person-group-elements;, which will be mixed with #PCDATA
       as defined in references.ent. The PE person-group-model has
       been retained in references.ent for compatibility, but has been
       set to the mixed model using person-group-elements.
  
    4. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
       @xml:lang to %display-atts;. Also added these attributes
       to the following over-rides:
        - inline-graphic through inline-graphic-atts (both)
        - fn through fn-atts (added @specific-use, @xml:lang already
            there)
        - person-group through person-group-atts (both)
  
    3. LABEL - Added optional <label> to <fig-group> using
       %fig-group-model; as the first element in model, before caption
  
    2. SELF URI - Added <self-uri> to <journal-meta> (directly
       following <notes>) so that an XML document can point to the
       journal home page.
  
       =============================================================
       Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)
  
       Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
       In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
       elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
       to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
       All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
       web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.
  
       Details on version 3.0 are available at
             http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

          <xi:include> (whose namespaces JATS

       Great care should be taken to use these
    attributes judiciously, not as a shortcut to
    thinking through where an attribute should be
    used. Potential use cases include adding
    @xml:lang or some RDFa attribute to every
