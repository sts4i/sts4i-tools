     NISO STS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022)
                                      (DAL/BTU) v1.2 (2022-10-31)
      
     ANSI NISO STS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO STS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on October 21, 2022, so it supersedes the 
     2017 version and all committee drafts, becoming 
     NISO STS v1.2 20221031 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022).

     The formal public identifiers have been changed in the  
     modules and the OASIS XML catalogs.
 
  4. NISO STS 'v1.1d1 20210831' becomes 'v1.2 20221031'
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2017' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022'
 
     =============================================================
     NISO STS Version 1.1d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-202x)
                                  (DAL/BTU) v1.1d1 (2021-08-31)
      
     ANSI NISO STS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This ***DRAFT*** DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative STS DTD Suite, as an indication to STS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the STS Standing
     Committee. This DRAFT has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. 

     The formal public identifiers have been changed in the  
     modules and the OASIS XML catalogs.

  3. TERM DISPLAY STRING - Added <term-display-string> to hold
     displayed text of various sorts inside <term-display>.
     Added <target> to %term-sec-link.class to be used inside
     <term-display-string>.

  2. RELATED TERM TYPE VALUES - @related-term-type values are 
     a closed set. The value "custom" was added to the list of 
     values and the attribute @custom-type added to:  
      - <related-term>. 

  1. STS 'v1.0 20171031' becomes 'v1.1d1 20210831' 
                                                                   -->

<!--                    TERM AND DEFINITION SECTION DESIGN NOTE    -->
<!-- ============================================================= -->

<!--       There are two very different ways the term and 
           definitions in a standard may be tagged. Both occur 
           optionally inside a Term Section (<term-sec>):

             - <tbx:termEntry> models a term using the 
               TBX-namespaced vocabulary and ontology for terms.
 
            - <term-display> uses natural language to describe terms,
               which may OR MAY NOT incorporate semantic term 
               elements such as definition and related term. Semantic 
               tagging is encouraged, but nothing is enforced.

           This module expands the ISO STS <term-display> model,
           instead of adding a 3rd model for terms and definitions, 
           so there will be TBX and <term-display> as alternative 
           ways to tag terms and definitions.

           The goals of the revised <term-display> model are to: 

            - Enable tagging term and definition content in the 
              sequence in which they appear in the display document

            - Enable, but not require, tagging of the principle semantic 
              content of term and definition sections, and specifically 
              to enable tagging that will allow extraction of terms and 
              definitions for use in glossaries containing terms and 
              definitions from multiple Standards

            - Make tagging existing terms and definitions easy

            - Be backward compatible with ISO STS V1.1.            -->

                        a standards document, which may include
                        TBX-based terminology sections or just
                        natural language <term-display> elements that
                        describe term and definition material.
                          Remarks: A <term-sec> is not, in spite of
                        its English name, a "Section" (like <sec>)
                        within a standard. A <term-sec> is a 
                        container element that holds TBX entries 
                        and/or <term-display> terms. A <term-sec> 
                        should always be used inside a Section
                        that has a @sec-type such as 'term'
                           (<sec sec-type-"terms">)
                        Best Practice: Although <term-sec> is allowed
                        directly inside the many elements such as 
                        <body> and <back>, these are historical 
                        remnants, and <term-sec> should be restricted
                        to terminology sections in the front matter or
                        body. That is, a <term-sec> should only be used 
                        inside <sec> elements that contain terms and
                        definitions or recursively inside another
