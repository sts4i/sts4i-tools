Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)  
     =============================================================
     NISO STS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022)
                                      (DAL/BTU) v1.2 (2022-10-31)
      
     ANSI NISO STS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO STS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on October 21, 2022, so it supersedes the 
     2017 version and all committee drafts, becoming 
     NISO STS v1.2 20221031 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022).

     The formal public identifiers have been changed in the  
     modules and the OASIS XML catalogs.
 
  3. NISO STS 'v1.1d1 20210831' becomes 'v1.2 20221031'
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2017' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022'
 
     =============================================================
     NISO STS Version 1.1d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-202x)
                                  (DAL/BTU) v1.1d1 (2021-08-31)
      
     ANSI NISO STS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This ***DRAFT*** DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative STS DTD Suite, as an indication to STS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the STS Standing
     Committee. This DRAFT has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. 

     The formal public identifiers have been changed in the  
     modules and the OASIS XML catalogs.

  2. KEYWORDS - Went to add <kwd-group> to <nat-meta> and found it
     already there. So it is after <abstract> and not logically
     with ICS codes and Subjects where it probably belongs. 

  1. STS 'v1.0 20171031' becomes 'v1.1d1 20210831'

                        metadata specific to or produced by an
                        ISO-related national standards body.
                           REMARKS: This element contains any
                        national-organization-specific overrides to
                        the metadata described for the whole standards 
                        document (<std-doc-meta>) as well as the 
                        organization-specific metadata for the 
                        national standards body. The element 
                        <nat-meta> is the 4th of the organizational 
                        metadata elements with <iso-meta>, 
                        <reg-meta>, and <std-meta>. By design, the                                                       <nat-meta> content model is very similar to 
                        that of <iso-meta>.                        -->
