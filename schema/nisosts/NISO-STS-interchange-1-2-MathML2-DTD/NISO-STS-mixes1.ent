     NISO STS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022)

     ANSI NISO STS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO STS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on October 21, 2022, so it supersedes the 
     2017 version and all committee drafts, becoming 
     NISO STS v1.2 20221031 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022).

     The formal public identifiers have been changed in the  
     modules and the OASIS XML catalogs.
 
  3. NISO STS 'v1.1d1 20210831' becomes 'v1.2 20221031'
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2017' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022'

     ANSI NISO STS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This ***DRAFT*** DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative STS DTD Suite, as an indication to STS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the STS Standing
     Committee. This DRAFT has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. 

     The formal public identifiers have been changed in the  
     modules and the OASIS XML catalogs.

  2. TERM DISPLAY CLASS - Added <term-display-string> to hold
     displayed text of various sorts inside <term-display>
     That cannot be tagged using one of the semantic term-display
     elements.
     Class is used in side %inside-term-display-mix.

  1. STS 'v1.0 20171031' becomes 'v1.1d1 20210831'

                        emphasis elements, as well as subscript and
                        superscript.  Usually used in a model that
                        allows #PCDATA and this restricted mixture.
                        This mix may be enhanced slightly in some
                        more permissive DTDs, and should always
                        contain at least typographic emphasis,
                        subscript, and superscript.

                        and the related PE "just-rendition" have
                        been put in place to restrict the amount of
                        variability that a person modifying the DTD
                        through PE redefinition can achieve. Some
                        elements have been set #PCDATA plus one PE
                        and some have been set to #PCDATA plus the
                        other in an effort to allow designers to
                        modify entire groups of elements, but not
                        to individually change similar models.

                        Design Note: Inside cell is an exception, an
                        inline mix that does not start with an OR
                        bar. This is because it is used within the
                        PE %Flow.mix;, which is an inline mix
                        defined in the course of the XHTML Table DTD,

                        example inside a Section

                        that are at the same level as a paragraph.
                        Inline elements appear only inside a
                        paragraph, but block elements such as quotes
                        and lists may appear either within a
                        paragraph or at the same level as a
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material
                        will have restricted such elements to only
                        inside a paragraph,  some incoming material
                        will have restricted them to only outside a
                        paragraph and some may allow them in both
                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      

                        Change to use %nothing-but-para.class instead
                        of %just-para.class, to avoid determinism
