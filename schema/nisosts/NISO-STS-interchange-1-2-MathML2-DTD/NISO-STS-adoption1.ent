     =============================================================
     NISO STS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022)
                                      (DAL/BTU) v1.2 (2022-10-31)
      
     ANSI NISO STS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO STS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on October 21, 2022, so it supersedes the 
     2017 version and all committee drafts, becoming 
     NISO STS v1.2 20221031 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022).

     The formal public identifiers have been changed in the  
     modules and the OASIS XML catalogs.
 
  4. NISO STS 'v1.1d1 20210831' becomes 'v1.2 20221031'
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2017' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022'
 
     =============================================================
     NISO STS Version 1.1d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-202x)
                                  (DAL/BTU) v1.1d1 (2021-08-31)
      
     ANSI NISO STS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This ***DRAFT*** DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative STS DTD Suite, as an indication to STS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the STS Standing
     Committee. This DRAFT has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. 

     The formal public identifiers have been changed in the  
     modules and the OASIS XML catalogs.

  3. PROCESSING METADATA - Added <processing-meta> to the
     model of the top-level <adoption> element.       

  2. DTD VERSION - The top-level attribute @dtd-version (used for
     <standard> and <adoption>, has been a #FIXED attribute for all 
     of JATS, ISO-STS, and STS history. This is very convenient
     when creating new documents, but problematic for archives
     who may receive many different versions over time. If a document
     is valid to "v1.1d1"; it is also valid to the latest version
     and to all older versions. @dtd-version will stay a CDATA
     attribute, but will be optional, with a list of values, and
     with no default.

  1. STS 'v1.0 20171031' becomes 'v1.1d1 20210831' 
                                                                   -->
