<!--             metadata elements <iso-meta>, <reg-meta>, and     -->
<!--             <nat-meta>, but which is not tied to a particular -->
<!--             type of standards organization.                   -->

     NISO STS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022)
                                      (DAL/BTU) v1.2 (2022-10-31)
      
     ANSI NISO STS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO STS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on October 21, 2022, so it supersedes the 
     2017 version and all committee drafts, becoming 
     NISO STS v1.2 20221031 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022).

     The formal public identifiers have been changed in the  
     modules and the OASIS XML catalogs.
 
  3. NISO STS 'v1.1d1 20210831' becomes 'v1.2 20221031'
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2017' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.102-2022'
 
     =============================================================
     NISO STS Version 1.1d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.102-202x)
                                  (DAL/BTU) v1.1d1 (2021-08-31)
      
     ANSI NISO STS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This ***DRAFT*** DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative STS DTD Suite, as an indication to STS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the STS Standing
     Committee. This DRAFT has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. 

     The formal public identifiers have been changed in the  
     modules and the OASIS XML catalogs.

  2. KEYWORDS - Went to add <kwd-group> to <std-meta> and found it
     already there. So it is after <abstract> and not logically
     with ICS codes and Subjects where it probably belongs. 

  1. STS 'v1.0 20171031' becomes 'v1.1d1 20210831'

<!--                    The <std-meta> is a container element for
                        metadata specific to or produced by a
                        standards producing organization (such as 
                        ISO or an SDO) that is publishing or
                        adopting the standard.
                           REMARKS: This element contains any
                        organization-specific overrides to the
                        metadata described for the whole standards 
                        document (<std-doc-meta>) as well as the 
                        organization-specific metadata for one 
                        standards producing organization. 
                          Remarks: In the ISO STS Tag Set from which
                        this Tag Set was derived, this element did
                        not exist. There were three metadata containers
                        to hold standard organization metadata:
                         -  <iso-meta> (metadata concerning ISO itself), 
                         -  <nat-meta> (metadata concerning an 
                              ISO-related national standards body), and 
                         -  <reg-meta> (metadata concerning an 
                              ISO-related regional standards body).
                        The newer <std-meta> element may be used to 
                        describe organizations (such as SDOs) that
                        are not part of the ISO infrastructure or
                        it may be used to describe any standards
                        organization, replacing any or all of these
                        three ISO STS container elements.          -->
